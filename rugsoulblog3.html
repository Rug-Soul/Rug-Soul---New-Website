    <div class="box-content">
      <h3>Lokpath</h3>
      <p>The sea taught me that every wave is both return and release. This rug moves like that. A design for those who flow instead of force. The pattern rises and retreats, like breath. Like forgiveness. Let it remind you: to hold on loosely. To give space to come back. Not everything is lost when it leaves. Some things return stronger. Softer. Wiser.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-content">
      <h3>Cloudvine</h3>
      <p>I once tried to capture wind impossible, yet I tried. This rug is that attempt. A tribute to the unseen forces that shape us. The design flutters and folds, elusive but present. For those who trust what they can’t name. Who are guided by intuition, not instruction. Let it be your reminder that some truths don’t speak they whisper.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <div class="box-content">
      <h3>Veltrix</h3>
      <p>In a moment of grief, I traced circles over and over no end, no escape, just rhythm. This rug reflects that cycle. A design of feeling through repetition. For those who heal in spirals, not lines. The pattern doesn’t promise closure only motion. Let it hold you while you go around again. Until it softens. Until it opens. It always does.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dpwvrinle/image/upload/v1745342363/Drag_tfm9h2.jpg" alt="Portrait">
    <div class="box-content">
      <h3>Blossomrift</h3>
      <p>A stranger once sang a lullaby on the metro. I never forgot it. This rug remembers too. A design of unexpected comfort. For those who find gentleness in the most unplanned places. The pattern hums like a song you never learned but somehow know. It says: you are held. Even here. Even now.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <div class="box-content">
      <h3>Zarkon</h3>
      <p>In the garden, I watched vines twist toward the light, no matter the obstacle. That instinct became thread. This rug is for the resilient. The seekers. The quiet risers. Its pattern climbs without apology. Let it remind you: your direction is more important than your speed. Keep growing. Even slowly. Especially slowly.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <div class="box-content">
      <h3>Goldenfawn</h3>
      <p>I once danced in a thunderstorm, barefoot, alone, unafraid. That wildness etched itself into this design. For the untamed souls. The rebels. The passionate. The pattern claps and crashes — a storm in fiber. It doesn’t apologize for its volume. Neither should you.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

      <h3>Trivex</h3>
      <p>In the museum, I found myself staring at a blank canvas more than the paintings. That silence inspired this rug. A piece for the interpreters. The minimalists. The ones who find story in space. It doesn’t show it suggests. Let it be your reflection. Your echo. Your invitation.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

      <h3>Shadewalk</h3>
      <p>I once got lost on purpose just to find what I’d never seek. This rug maps that journey. A design for the wanderers. For those who believe detours are divine. The pattern shifts with each glance. It says: being lost is a form of being free.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-content">
      <h3>Cyron</h3>
      <p>A paper crane left on a park bench sparked this design. A gesture of peace, placed and forgotten. This rug is for the quiet givers. The ones who bless without needing credit. The folds hold intention. The shape, quiet strength. Let it honor your silent kindness.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>Wildterra</h3>
      <p>I read somewhere that stardust lives in our bones. I believed it. This rug glows from that truth. A design for the cosmic souls. The ones who know they’re part of something far greater. Let it root you in wonder. You are not small. You are starlight walking.</p>

      <p>In the city’s noise, I found a bench tucked away, wrapped in ivy. That hidden hush became this rug. A piece for the ones who carve out peace in chaos. The pattern wraps you in green silence. A secret in plain sight.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

      <h3>Elira</h3>
      <p>I watched an old man feed birds with no audience, no reward. That devotion shaped this piece. A rug for those who give with no need to be seen. Its pattern is quiet service. Let it remind you: goodness isn’t always loud. But it lasts.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

 <div class="box">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dpwvrinle/image/upload/v1745342399/Elyza_h9huuv.jpg" alt="Portrait">
    <div class="box-content">
      <h3>Elyza</h3>
      <p>I once fell asleep to the hum of a train and dreamt of movement. This rug carries that rhythm. A design for the journeyers. The travelers. The restless hearts. It pulses forward, gently. Let it go with you — even when you’re standing still.</p>

      <p>In the distance, a mountain once whispered its secrets to me. I had to listen. This rug echoes that quiet wisdom. A design for those who know there’s depth in silence.

    </div>
  </div>

      <h3>Icebay</h3>
      <p>A flower once bloomed in the middle of an old sidewalk, unnoticed but unapologetic. This rug is for those who grow where they’re planted.
