      <h3>Midnight Glade</h3>
      <p>The sharp beauty of jagged cliffs overlooking a vast ocean inspired this design. The harshness of the rocks contrasts with the softness of the sea, forming a perfect harmony between opposites. Crafted for those who appreciate the beauty of contrast. The rug represents the harmony that can exist between seemingly opposing forces, with each knot reflecting the strength found in both softness and sharpness. Made for those who embrace the balance between opposing elements, bringing both power and peace into their surroundings.</p>

      <h3>Forest Halo</h3>
      <p>The calm ripples across a still pond, disturbed only by a single stone dropped in, gave rise to this design. The concentric circles spread slowly, touching everything in their path. Crafted for those who understand that even the smallest actions can have far-reaching effects. The rug reflects the subtlety of change, with each knot symbolizing the ripple effect that spreads across life. Made for spaces where the quiet impact of every movement is felt deeply, offering a sense of mindful presence.

      <h3>Golden Whisper</h3>
      <p>The deep echo of distant thunder rolling over a valley filled with heavy rain formed the inspiration for this design. The storm’s power is tempered by its rhythm, like a song that speaks to the heart. Crafted for those who understand the beauty of controlled chaos. The rug captures the dance between tension and release, with each knot reflecting the delicate balance of nature’s forces. Made for spaces where energy flows freely, yet peace is ever present, offering both movement and calm.</p>
